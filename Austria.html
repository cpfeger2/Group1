<h2>Austria</h2>
<p>Small yet beautiful, Austria has unrivaled Alpine scenery, some of Europe's finest baroque
architecture, and a long musical and cultural tradition. The Austrian people also are known
for their warmth and hospitality toward visitors. Straddling the center of Europe, the country
has exerted a critical influence on the region's history through the centuries, becoming a 
major player in world politics. Today, despite loss of territory and power after two world wars, Austria retains its status as 
the crossroads of modern Europe. The grandeur of the mountains draws visitors from all over 
the world, while the combination of efficiency and charm makes Austria one of Europe's most 
beguiling tourist destinations.</p>
