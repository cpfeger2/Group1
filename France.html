<h2>France</h2>
<p>France is the largest country in western Europe, geographically one of the most diverse,
and certainly among the most beautiful. Its cities contain some of the greatest treasures in
Europe; its countryside is prosperous and well tended. The French combine practicality with
romance; they lead a stylish life, eat delicious food and bask in a pleasant climate. Historically, France has developed the notion of equality for all and, while retaining its
sense of tradition, remains a forward-looking country. Over the past half-century, for instance,
the French have forged ahead in modern technology. France is a country of contrasts, making
it a delight to explore.</p>
