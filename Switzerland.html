<h2>Switzerland</h2>
<p>With stunning Alpine scenery, lush meadows, a medley of beautiful lakes and attractive
cities and towns, Switzerland has a wonderful variety of natural and man-made attractions.
Remaining neutral through both world wars, Switzerland emerged in 1945 as a powerful commercial
player. Banking has long thrived here due to the political stability of the country and because
of Swiss financial acumen. The superb infrastructure of railroads, tunnels and roads has overcome
the daunting mountainous terrain and allows the country to exploit a trading position at the center
of Europe.</p>
